# React Starter

A react starter to help me quick start projects with React and Webpack. More or less for personal use but if you find it useful PRs are welcome. Includes the following:

* [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
    * [React DOM](https://github.com/facebook/react)

* [Redux](https://github.com/rackt/redux) for managing state
    * [Redux Thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) - allow async reducers
    * [Redux Persists](https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist) - store state

* [React Router](https://github.com/rackt/react-router)
    * Uses [history](https://github.com/rackt/history)

* [SASS Loader](https://github.com/jtangelder/sass-loader)
    * Import [SASS](http://sass-lang.com/) directly into React files

* [Webpack](https://webpack.github.io/)
    * [webpack-dev-server](https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server)
    * [sourcemaps](https://webpack.github.io/docs/configuration.html)
    * [ES6 with Babel Loader](https://github.com/babel/babel-loader)
    * Linting with [eslint](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) & [eslint-loader](https://github.com/MoOx/eslint-loader)

* [Jest](https://github.com/facebook/jest) with [Karma](https://github.com/karma-runner/karma) runner
    * ES6 support using [webpack-babel-jest](https://github.com/atecarlos/webpack-babel-jest)


Other libraries
* [Isomorphic-fetch](https://github.com/matthew-andrews/isomorphic-fetch) (allows `fetch()` instead of normal AJAX mess)
* [Moment](https://github.com/moment/moment). Cuz it's the best.
